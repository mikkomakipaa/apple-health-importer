**Readiness Scoring:**
- 🎯 **Daily Readiness**: 0-100 score from weighted factors:
  - HRV Score (40% weight)
  - RHR Score (30% weight)  
  - Sleep Score (30% weight)
- 📈 **Score Trends**: Historical readiness patterns and improvements

### 🔍 **6. Data Quality & Ops**
*Technical monitoring and data reliability*

**Data Monitoring:**
- 🔥 **Completeness Heatmap**: Missing data visualization by metric and hour
- ⏰ **Data Freshness**: Ingestion lag and last update timestamps

**Quality Assurance:**
- 🚨 **Outlier Detection**: Z-score analysis for abnormal readings (>3 standard deviations)
- 📈 **Data Trends**: Long-term data quality and completeness tracking
- ⚙️ **System Health**: Technical metrics for monitoring data pipeline

## 🧮 Advanced Calculations & Formulas

### Readiness Score Formula
```
Readiness = (HRV_Score × 0.4) + (RHR_Score × 0.3) + (Sleep_Score × 0.3)

Where:
- HRV_Score = HRV_SDNN × 1.2 (capped at 100)
- RHR_Score = 100 - Resting_HR (normalized)
- Sleep_Score = (Sleep_Hours ÷ 8) × 100 (capped at 100)
```

### ACWR (Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio)
```
ACWR = Acute_Load ÷ Chronic_Load

Where:
- Acute_Load = Average training load over 7 days
- Chronic_Load = Average training load over 28 days
- Training_Load = Duration × Intensity_Factor

Injury Risk Zones:
- 0.8-1.3: Optimal (Green)
- 1.3-1.5: Caution (Yellow)  
- >1.5: High Risk (Red)
```

### Stress Index
```
Stress_Index = (HRV_SDNN ÷ Heart_Rate) × 100

Lower values indicate higher stress:
- >2.0: Low stress
- 1.0-2.0: Moderate stress
- <1.0: High stress
```
